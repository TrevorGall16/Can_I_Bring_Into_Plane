High-Visibility & Monetization Guidelines for Programmatic Tools

1. Core Philosophy

    Speed is Currency: The site must load in under 1 second. Every extra second of loading costs 10% of ad revenue.

    Answer First, Context Second: The user has a problem ("Can I bring X?"). Give the answer immediately (Yes/No). Do not bury it.

    Scale via Structure: We do not write manual blog posts. We build "Data Templates" that generate thousands of useful pages programmatically.

2. Technical SEO (The "Indexability" Rules)

    One Item = One URL: Every unique piece of data (e.g., "Shampoo") MUST have its own indexable URL (e.g., domain.com/item/shampoo or ?id=shampoo).

    Dynamic Metadata: The <title> and <meta description> must match the specific content of the view, not the general site name.

        Bad: "Travel Rules Website"

        Good: "Can I bring Shampoo on a Plane? | TSA Rules 2025"

    Sitemap is Mandatory: Even for client-side apps, an XML sitemap listing every possible data view must exist to guide Googlebot.

3. User Experience (UX) for Revenue

    The "Fold" Rule: The user must see the Answer AND the first Ad without scrolling.

    Stability (CLS): Ads must have reserved space (fixed height/width CSS). If content jumps when an ad loads, Google penalizes the ranking.

    Search Bar Prominence: On a database site, the Search Bar is the main navigation. It must be sticky or immediately available.

4. Monetization Strategy

    Ad Density:

        Mobile: One "Sticky Footer" ad + One "In-Content" ad.

        Desktop: One "Sidebar" ad + One "Leaderboard" (top) + One "In-Content" ad.

    Refreshes: For Single Page Apps (SPA), ads must refresh logic-ally (e.g., every time the user clicks a new result), not just on page load.

    Affiliate Layer: Do not rely solely on ads. Programmatically insert affiliate links relevant to the item category (e.g., Result: "Drone" -> Link: "Buy Drone Travel Case").

5. Content Quality Standards

    Avoid "Thin Content": A "Yes/No" is not enough for AdSense. The template must auto-populate:

        The Answer.

        The Official Rule (TSA/ICAO citation).

        Packing Tips.

        Exceptions (e.g., quantity limits).

    E-E-A-T Signals: The site must have an "About" page explaining the data source (e.g., "Data sourced from official TSA guidelines") to build trust.
