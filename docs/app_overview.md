# 1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

## 1. Project Type
**Category:** High-Utility SPA (Single Page Application) / Travel Compliance Tool.
**Tech:** Path A (Vanilla JS, No Build Step).

## 2. One-Sentence Summary
"Can I Bring This On A Plane?" is a fast, offline-capable search engine that relieves pre-flight anxiety by telling travelers exactly what they can pack, functioning as a definitive, interactive pre-flight compliance report.

## 3. Core Purpose
To transform the stressful question "Will security take this?" into a confident "Pre-Flight Compliance Report," allowing users to build a verifiable checklist before they leave home.

## 4. Target Users
* **The Anxious Packer:** Wants 100% certainty to avoid confrontation at TSA.
* **The Last-Minute Traveler:** Needs an instant answer (under 2 seconds) at the airport with spotty signal.
* **The International Flyer:** Needs to know if rules change between USA/EU/UK.

## 5. Core Features (Input → Output)
1.  **Instant Search:** User types "Razor" → Card shows "✅ Carry-On Allowed" (Disposable) vs "❌ Prohibited" (Safety).
2.  **Pre-Flight Checklist (Retention):** User clicks "Add to Checklist" → Builds a persistent "Compliance Report" showing total allowed/prohibited items.
3.  **Contextual Monetization (Revenue):** User views "iPhone" → System suggests "eSIM Data Plan" (High Margin) instead of generic ads.
4.  **Smart Routing (SEO):** User lands on `/?item=shampoo` → App loads dynamic metadata + canonical tags for indexing.

## 6. Constraints & Priorities
* **Performance First:** TTFB < 100ms. No heavy frameworks.
* **Zero "Soft 404s":** Every item must have a valid, indexable URL.
* **Anxiety Relief UI:** No "Red Alerts" unless necessary. Use calming, authoritative colors (Blues/Greens).
* **AdSense Compliance:** Homepage must include "Methodology & FAQ" text to avoid "Low Value Content" flags.

## 7. Success Criteria
* **Retention:** Users add >3 items to their Checklist per session.
* **Revenue:** Click-through rate on High-Margin Affiliates (Insurance/eSIM) > 1%.
* **SEO:** 100% of "Item Pages" indexed by Google (No "Duplicate Content" errors).
