# ADS_AND_INDEXING_GUIDELINES

This document defines **exact rules** for generating your website's **Ads Placement Strategy** and **Indexing / SEO Strategy**.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

The AI reading this document must understand:
* **Google AdSense Strictness:** Tool/Utility sites are often rejected for "Low Value Content". This document prevents that.
* **Where ads must appear** (Placement Strategy).
* **How ads must be implemented** based on the Tech Stack (Vanilla vs. Framework).
* **How the website must be indexed** for maximum search visibility.

---

## 2. OUTPUT FORMAT

When an AI writes the "Ads & Indexing" document, it must follow this structure **exactly**:

1. **AdSense Compliance Strategy (The "High-Value" Rule)**
2. **Ads Strategy Summary**
3. **Ad Placements (Visual Rules)**
4. **Ad Behavior Logic (Technical Implementation)**
5. **Indexing Strategy Summary**
6. **Technical SEO Requirements**
7. **Metadata Requirements**
8. **Sitemap & Robots Rules**
9. **Schema Markup Requirements**

---

## 3. ADSENSE COMPLIANCE STRATEGY (CRITICAL)

To avoid "Low Value Content" rejection, the Architect AI must enforce the following **Content-First** rules:

### 3.1 The "High-Value" Homepage Rule
* **Prohibition:** The homepage MUST NOT consist only of inputs, buttons, or a search bar.
* **Requirement:** The initial view (Main Container) must contain **300-500 words of static, helpful content** visible immediately.
* **Content Types:** "How to use this tool", "Methodology", "Common Rules", or "FAQ".
* **Reasoning:** Google bots do not click buttons. If the value only appears *after* interaction, the bot sees an empty page.

### 3.2 The "Reset" Protocol
* **Logic:** When a user resets the tool or clicks "Back":
    * **Path A (Vanilla):** The `resetToHome()` function must **re-inject the full text block** (from 3.1). It must NEVER leave the container empty.
    * **Path B (Framework):** The home route must always render the text component by default.

## 4. ADS STRATEGY GUIDELINES

### 4.1 Principles
* Ads must **never** be intrusive.
* Ads must **blend visually** but remain identifiable.
* Ads must follow **responsiveness rules**.

### 4.2 Types of Allowed Ads
The AI may generate documentation that includes:
* **Banner Ads** (horizontal)
* **Square Ads** (box / tile)
* **Native In-feed Ads**
Internal links must never be blocked by ads or scripts.


### 4.3 Placement Logic (Mandatory Visual Patterns)

The AI must always follow these rules regarding **location**:

#### A. Forbidden Areas (Strict)
* **NO ADS** in the Navigation Panel / Sidebar (Left Panel).
* **NO ADS** on screens that have no publisher content (e.g., a loading screen or empty result state).
* **NO ADS** that disappear when the user interacts (causes layout shift violations).

#### B. Header Area
* 1 banner allowed.
* Must never push down the main navigation.

#### C. Main Page Content (Right Panel)
* Insert ads **after text blocks** or **below specific results**.
* Minimum spacing: **500–700 px vertical distance**.
* Max 3 ads per page view.

#### D. Mobile Rules
* Max 1–2 ads visible at any time.
* Ads must respect viewport height (no >25% of screen).

### 4.4 Technical Implementation (CRITICAL)

The AI must define the implementation method based on the chosen **Tech Stack**:

**IF PATH A (Vanilla JS):**
* **Method:** Manual DOM Injection.
* **Logic:** On navigation (virtual route change), the code must explicitly clear the `.ad-container` HTML and re-run the ad script.
* **Class:** Use a global `AdManager` class.

**IF PATH B (Next.js / Framework):**
* **Method:** Component-based.
* **Logic:** Wrap ads in an `<AdUnit />` component.
* **Refresh:** Use `useEffect` (React) to detect route changes and trigger a refresh of the specific ad slot.
* **Constraint:** NEVER use `innerHTML` or `document.write`.

GDPR & CMP Mandates: For any project using AdMob or AdSense, a Consent Management Platform (CMP) must be initialized before the SDK to ensure GDPR compliance and full monetization.

External Script Validation: Always use explicit window assignments (e.g., window.adsbygoogle) and check for the script's existence before calling it to prevent ReferenceErrors that can halt all site JavaScript.

### 4.5 CLS Prevention (All Stacks)
* All ad containers must have a CSS `min-height` (e.g., 250px) to reserve space before the ad loads.

## 5. INDEXING & SEO STRATEGY

### 5.1 Indexing Guidelines
The AI must:
* Define how crawlers navigate the site.
* Explicitly state which pages are **indexed** vs **noindexed**.

### 5.2 URL Structure Rules
* Use clean, lowercase, hyphen-separated URLs.
* **Path A (Vanilla):** Use query slugs (`?item=camera-lens`).
* **Path B (Framework):** Use path slugs (`/item/camera-lens`).

### 5.3 Title & Meta Description Rules
* Titles: 50–60 characters.
* Descriptions: 140–160 characters.
* **Dynamic Update:**
    * **Vanilla:** `document.title = ...`
    * **Framework:** Use `export const metadata` or `<Head>` tags.

### 5.4 Header Structure Rules
* H1 = Page Title (Only one per view)
* H2 = Section Title
* H3 = Sub-section

* Canonical Consistency: The sitemap URLs must perfectly match the primary domain (WWW vs. Non-WWW) set in the hosting provider. * Dynamic Meta Bridge: For SPAs, the app must actively manage and update <link rel="canonical"> and Open Graph tags via JavaScript to prevent Google from seeing dynamic pages as duplicate content.

## 6. TECHNICAL SEO REQUIREMENTS

* **Lighthouse Targets:**
  * Performance: **>90**
  * SEO: **>95**
* **Images:** All images must include `alt` text and explicit width/height.
* **Lazy Loading:** Native `loading="lazy"` on all images below the fold.

---

## 7. SITEMAP & ROBOTS RULES

### 7.1 Sitemap
* Must include all indexable pages (or slugs).
* **Generation:**
    * **Path A:** Custom Node/Bun script.
    * **Path B:** Framework-native sitemap generation.

### 7.2 Robots.txt
* Allow list.
* Disallow list for private pages.
* Link to Sitemap.

---

## 8. SCHEMA MARKUP RULES

The AI must generate schema.org markup using JSON-LD.
Required:
* `WebSite`
* `WebPage`
* `BreadcrumbList`
Required schema types must be used when applicable:
- FAQPage
- HowTo
- SoftwareApplication
- Product
- Person / Organization
