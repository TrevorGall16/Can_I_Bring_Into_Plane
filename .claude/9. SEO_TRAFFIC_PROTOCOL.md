# SEO_TRAFFIC_PROTOCOL

**Purpose:**
This document provides the universal protocol for building high-ranking, indexable websites. It defines how to simulate multi-page architecture for crawlers, regardless of the technology stack used.

---

## 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

* **Speed is Ranking:** TTFB < 200ms, LCP < 2.5s.
* **Zero "Soft 404s":** Every navigable content piece must have a unique, indexable URL.
* **Virtual Routing:** The application must update the browser History API and Page Metadata on every view change.

---

## 2. ARCHITECTURE PROTOCOLS (SELECT ONE)

The Builder AI must determine the Tech Stack from `TechStackGuideline.md` and apply the matching protocol below.

### Protocol A: The "Vanilla Lite" (Client-Side / No Build)
*Applies when using: Vanilla JS, jQuery, plain HTML/CSS.*

1.  **File Structure:** `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` (Root only).
2.  **Routing:** Use `history.pushState()` manually.
3.  **Initialization:** On `window.onload`, parse `window.location.search` to determine content.
4.  **Google Visibility:** Google does not click buttons. All clickable items must be `<a href="?item=slug">` or managed via pushState with a fallback.

### Protocol B: The "Modern Framework" (Next.js / Astro / Svelte)
*Applies when using: Next.js, Astro, React Router, SvelteKit.*

1.  **Routing:** NEVER use `history.pushState` manually. Use the framework's router (e.g., `next/navigation`, `react-router-dom`).
2.  **Rendering:** Prefer Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for content pages.
3.  **Hydration:** Ensure metadata (Title, Meta Description) is updated by the framework's head manager (e.g., Next.js `generateMetadata`).

## 3. DATA STRUCTURING FOR SEO

### 3.1 Slug Rule (MANDATORY)
Every distinct object (product, calculator result, directory item) must have a slug.

* **BAD:** `?id=123`
* **GOOD:** `?item=camera-lens` (Vanilla) or `/item/camera-lens` (Framework)

### 3.2 Sitemap Logic
* **Vanilla Projects:** Create a standalone script (e.g., `scripts/generate_sitemap.js`) that reads the JSON data and outputs `sitemap.xml` to root.
* **Framework Projects:** Use the framework's sitemap generation tools (e.g., `next-sitemap` or a `sitemap.ts` route).

---

## 4. GLOBAL INDEXING STRATEGY

### 4.1 The "One Page" Trap
Single Page Apps (SPAs) appear to Google as 1 page unless explicit routes exist.
* **Requirement:** Ensure direct access to any deep URL (e.g., `domain.com/?item=slug`) loads the specific item immediately without user interaction.

### 4.2 Robots.txt
Standard configuration:
```txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: [Insert Production URL]/sitemap.xml

---


### 5. CONTENT ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY

Every project must define a topical structure composed of:
- 1 Pillar Page (core topic)
- Multiple Supporting Pages (clusters)

Rules:
- Pillar pages target broad, high-volume queries
- Supporting pages target long-tail, specific intents
- Supporting pages must internally link to the Pillar
- Pillar pages must link back to key Supporting pages


---

### 6. PROGRAMMATIC SEO RULES

If structured data exists (items, tools, locations, configurations):
- Each item must generate a unique indexable URL
- Each page must include:
  - Unique title & meta description
  - 250–300 words of non-template text
  - Contextual explanation and usage
Thin or duplicate pages are forbidden.

## INTERNAL LINKING RULES

Every page must:
- Link to 3–10 internal pages
- Receive links from at least 3 internal pages
- Use descriptive, partial-match anchor text
Breadcrumb navigation is mandatory.


---

## CONTENT FRESHNESS PROTOCOL

All indexable pages must expose:
- datePublished
- dateModified

When content is updated:
- dateModified must change
- Visible "Last updated" label is required


---

## TRUST & AUTHORITY RULES

Every site must include:
- About page
- Contact page
- Author or Organization information

Claims must be:
- Explained
- Justified
- Sourced when applicable


---

## SERP OPTIMIZATION RULES

Titles must:
- Be compelling, not just descriptive
- Use numbers or benefit-driven phrasing when relevant

Meta descriptions must:
- State clear value
- Match page intent
- Avoid generic summaries


---

## INDEXING DECISION MATRIX

Only pages that:
- Serve unique intent
- Provide value
- Have potential search demand
may be indexed.

Filter pages, internal search pages, and empty states must be noindexed.


---

## MULTI-CHANNEL VISIBILITY

All pages must include:
- Open Graph metadata
- Share-friendly summaries

Content must be structured for:
- Featured snippets
- AI / LLM extraction (clear definitions, FAQs)


---

## CANONICAL & CRAWL BUDGET RULES

- Every indexable page must define a canonical URL
- URL parameters must be canonicalized to the primary slug
- Duplicate content variants must never be indexable
- Paginated pages must not override the canonical of the root listing

---

## PAGINATION & FACET RULES

- Paginated pages must be crawlable
- Paginated pages must not compete with the main page
- Faceted combinations are noindex by default
- Only manually promoted facets may be indexed


---

## STRUCTURED DATA REQUIREMENTS

Schema markup is mandatory when applicable.
JSON-LD must be used.

Priority:
- WebPage
- BreadcrumbList
- FAQPage (if FAQs exist)
- HowTo (for guides)
- SoftwareApplication (for tools)


---

## USER ENGAGEMENT SIGNALS

Pages must:
- Avoid empty above-the-fold states
- Present immediate informational value
- Encourage scrolling and interaction through content structure

Pure UI-first or interaction-only pages are forbidden.


---

## SEO FEEDBACK LOOP

The system must monitor:
- Index coverage
- Impressions vs CTR
- Page-level performance

Low-CTR or underperforming pages must be eligible for title, content, or structure updates.
