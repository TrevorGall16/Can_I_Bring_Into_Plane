        <h1>About Airport Carry-On Checker</h1>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Traveling should be exciting, not stressful. Airport Carry-On Checker was created to answer the most common question travelers face: "Can I bring this on the plane?" Our goal is to provide instant, clear, and accurate information about airport security rules to help you pack with confidence.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>We aggregate data from major aviation security authorities, including the TSA (USA), EASA (Europe), CATSA (Canada), and others. We organize this information into a simple, searchable format so you don't have to dig through complex government websites.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global Standards:</strong> We cross-reference rules from multiple international security agencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Up-to-Date:</strong> We regularly review our database against the latest security guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We do not track your personal searches or store your packing lists on our servers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>While we strive for accuracy, airport security rules can change without notice, and the final decision always rests with the security officer at the airport. This website is for informational guidance only. Always check with your specific airline or the local security authority before you travel.</p>
